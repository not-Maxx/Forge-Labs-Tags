```
Each minecraft day lasts around 20 minutes
100 days -> 100 * 20 minutes = 2000 minutes
2000 minutes / 60 = 33.33 hours
33.33 hours, that's gameplay alone

Sean and his editor need to find out what's going in the video
He also has to record his voiceovers
His 100 day video have an average duration of 1:15:10
He records multiple times until he gets something he likes
The editor has to compile everything and edit it

The entire process can take weeks, or even months to complete
